Call for Computing and archiving resources
*********
.. centered:: (closing date 30/11/2023)

INAF's USC VIII-Computing issues a new call (the third one) for the use of HPC/HTC computing resources and for the availability of data storage spaces.


In particular, (i) the use of the INAF calculation system called PLEIADI will be offered, the technical characteristics of which are described on the site https://pleiadi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/index.html#cluster-structure , (ii) the use of the Leonardo BOOSTER calculation system will also be available, the technical characteristics of which are described on the site https://wiki.u-gov.it/confluence/display/SCAIUS, and (iii) the long-term conservation system of scientific products at IA2, described on the site https://www.ia2.inaf.it/index.php/ia2-services/data-sharing-preservation


Who can apply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Both individual researchers and teams belonging to research projects, European projects, PRIN, INAF mainstream projects, scientific missions, etc., which require long-term computing and data storage resources, can apply to the call.



Available Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Computing (Pleiadi)
-------------------

The call in question (which corresponds to number 3 for the PLEIADI system) makes a total of 15 million CORE hours available, which will be usable starting from 02/01/2024. Proposals for the use of computing e-infra that require a minimum of 100,000 CORE hours up to a maximum of 500,000 CORE hours will be evaluated. The assigned computing resources will be available for up to a maximum of 6 months from the aforementioned date of first use.


Computing (Cineca)
-------------------

As part of the agreement with Cineca, INAF offers 2.5 Million Standard Hours which will be usable from 02/01/2024. Proposals for computing resources requiring a minimum of 12,500 Standard Hours up to a maximum of 125,000 Standard Hours will be evaluated. The assigned computing resources will be available for up to a maximum of 6 months from the aforementioned date of first use.
In the context of this Call, the resources will be used on the Leonardo BOOSTER calculation system (https://wiki.u-gov.it/confluence/display/SCAIUS): please remember that 1 Standard Hour is equivalent to 1 CORE hour on Leonardo BOOSTER .
Projects can also require up to 4TB of work storage. Beyond these limits, additional disk resources may be requested (subject to verification of actual availability by CINECA). In this case the additional resources will be calculated as Equivalent Standard Hours with the following scheme:
1 TB/year is equivalent to:
500 standard hours on DRES-TAPE;
800 Standard Hours on DRES-FS;
1000 Standard Hours on DRES-REPO (single copy);
2000 standard hours on DRES-REPO (backup);
6000 standard hours on $WORK for HPC
More information on CINECA storage systems can be found at https://wiki.u-gov.it/confluence/display/SCAIUS/HPC+User+Guide


Long Term Storage (IA2)
-------------------



As in the previous call, INAF provides long-term data storage spaces, even completely free from the need for computing resources. This data will be made available starting from 02/01/2024. The typical dimensions of the spaces required in each individual proposal are up to 20TB. Their use may continue until the date indicated and justified by the applicant. Since data preservation will take place on Tape Library devices, it is advisable to carefully read the description of the data sharing and preservation services (https://www.ia2.inaf.it/index.php/ia2-services/data-sharing-preservation ) offered by IA2 as well as the description of the Long-Term Preservation service (https://www.ia2.inaf.it/index.php/ia2-services/data-sharing-preservation/long-term-preservation) for the preliminary measures necessary for preparing the data for the preservation and subsequent recovery of the data.






Proposal submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Proposals must be submitted by completing the form available at the link: https://forms.gle/QD2gGZhmgbvW1ATi7 starting from day  01/11/2023 and by 23:59 on day  30/11/2023.
In the application, the principal investigator will be required to specify in detail the scientific background, the technical characteristics of the code including libraries, computing environment, compilers, parallelism paradigm. Additionally, they will be required to describe any constraints on the use of resources (e.g., dedicated nodes, minimum number of nodes required per run, single-run execution time, total memory for single job, etc.) and to indicate the period during which they will use the allocated time. 
Proponents will also be required to specify the necessary storage space for code execution. This storage, which is not subject to backup, will be available for up to 6 months after the project's conclusion and is intended to be functional for data production (it is not the preservation storage). 
Unused allocated time cannot be recovered later.
Similarly, the request for long-term data preservation space must contain all the necessary data for the evaluation of the request: required preservation storage space size; type, format and size of each scientific product; description of the structure of the data collection; description of the expected access frequency as well as the data access policy; any future plan for publishing the data; all information deemed relevant for proper data preservation following the FAIR principles.
During the proposal evaluation phase, the Panel may request clarifications and further details from the proponents. Communication of the possible allocation of requested resources will normally occur within 4-5 weeks from the call closing date.

Additional info and Ex-post activities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from day 01/06/2023, it will also be possible to request “on-demand” resources, up to a maximum of 100,000 core/hours per project and up to the exhaustion of the available resources for this request mode, equal to 5,000,000 core/hours.
As regards CINECA and Leonardo Booster, it will be possible to request hours for "Tests" up to a maximum of 10,000 cores/hour per project.

At the end of the project, the proponent will be asked for a brief report on the results obtained and the criticalities encountered using the allocated resources. Failure to send this report precludes participation in the next call.
