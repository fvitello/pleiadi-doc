===================================
Rules for the Pleiadi cluster usage
===================================

#. Calculations, simulations, etc. have NEVER to be launched directly from command line on the frontend node, in order not to risk to make unusable the frontend node or other shared resources (penalty of account blocking and task interruption). ALWAYS pass through the execution queues of the SLURM scheduler (also in case of compilation).
#. It is NOT allowed to employ the resources for usage different from the research and/or teaching purposes.
#. Every user is responsable for every activity either performed by or attributable to herself/himself. Therefore, the account sharing is discouraged and it is only allowed if communicated in time to the HPC Staff. In general, it is NOT allowed to share sensitive data (e.g. username and password) that the user undertakes to properly store.
