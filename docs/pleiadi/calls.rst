Account and resources request
-----------------------------

The PLEIADI@INAF project provides HPC computing resources and technical support for research and teaching activities. 

The computing resources (see Section :doc:`Cluster structure <documentation/clusters/index>`) are managed by a board (board.pleiadi@inaf.it) which assigns calculation time and credentials for resources usage. 

To request calculation resources, you need to fill in an application form. The form and other information concerning the calculation resources can be found at the website `Resources <https://www.ict.inaf.it/computing/Pleiadi/>`_.

The user will receive an e-mail with credential details, i.e. a username and a password. The username will be of the form "Fistinitialof thenameSurname", all lowercase. The account is to be considered active from the moment you receive the confirmation e-mail containing your login credentials.

The account expires as indicated in the application form. To renew the account you must send again the same form sent in the first request, taking care to change the fields with the updated information.
