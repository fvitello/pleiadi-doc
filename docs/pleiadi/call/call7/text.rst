   <h2> INAF  -  USC VIII - Computing </h2>
   
---------------------

.. centered:: (closing date 28/02/2026)

INAF's USC-C issues a new call (the seventh one) for the use of HPC/HTC computing resources and for the availability of data storage spaces.
 
In particular:

(i) the use of the INAF computing  system called PLEIADI and PLEIADI-GPU will be offered, the technical characteristics of which are described on the site https://pleiadi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clusters/index.html ,
(ii) the use of the Leonardo BOOSTER computing system will also be available, the technical characteristics of which are described on the site https://leonardo-supercomputer.cineca.eu/hpc-system/,
(iii) the long-term preservation system of scientific products at IA2 will also be available, with characteristics described on the site https://www.ia2.inaf.it/index.php/ia2-services/data-sharing-preservation
 
Information about these systems for computing and data archiving/preservation can also be found in  the USC-C  website:    https://usc8.inaf.it
 
A ticketing system has also been setup to deal with technical problems related with the use of these systems: you can send your messages at  pleiadi-help@ced.inaf.it
 
 

Who can apply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both individual researchers and teams affiliated with research projects, such as European projects, PRIN projects, INAF mainstream projects, scientific missions, etc., may apply to the call.

In the case of applications submitted by INAF associates, it is mandatory that at least one INAF employee be included among the project collaborators.



Available Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Computing (Pleiadi)
------------------

The call in question offers a total of 10 million CORE hours, available starting from 01/04/2026. Proposals will be evaluated for the use of the computing e-infrastructure requesting a minimum of 100,000 CORE hours and up to a maximum of 500,000 CORE hours. 
The allocated computing resources will remain available for a maximum of 6 months from the aforementioned date of first use.
Projects may also request up to a maximum of 5 TB of work storage space.


Computing (Pleiadi-GPU)
-----------------------
The call in question provides a total of 200,000 GPU hours, which will be available starting from 01/04/2026. Proposals will be evaluated for the use of the computing e-infrastructure that request a minimum of 5,000 GPU hours and up to a maximum of 15,000 GPU hours. The allocated computing resources will remain available for up to 6 months from the aforementioned start date.
Projects may also request up to a maximum of 5 TB of work storage space.


Computing (Cineca)
-------------------

As part of the renewal—in the process of being defined—of the agreement with Cineca, INAF offers 1.5 Million Standard Hours which will be usable from 01/04/2026. Proposals for computing resources requiring a minimum of 12,500 Standard Hours up to a maximum of 125,000 Standard Hours will be evaluated. The assigned computing resources will be available for up to a maximum of 6 months from the aforementioned date of first use.
In the context of this Call, the resources will be used on the Leonardo BOOSTER calculation system (https://docs.hpc.cineca.it/hpc/leonardo.html): please remember that 1 Standard Hour is equivalent to 1 CORE hour on Leonardo BOOSTER .
Projects can also require up to 4TB of work storage. Beyond these limits, additional disk resources may be requested (subject to verification of actual availability by Cineca). In this case the additional resources will be calculated as Equivalent Standard Hours considering that 1 TB/year on DRES or WORK is equivalent to 800 Standard Hours.
More information on CINECA storage systems can be found at https://docs.hpc.cineca.it/hpc/hpc_data_storage.html#file-systems-and-data-management
 

Long Term Storage (IA2)
----------------------

INAF provides long-term data storage spaces, even completely free from the need for computing resources. These long-term storage spaces will be made available starting from 01/04/2026. The typical dimensions of the spaces required in each individual proposal are from 1TB  to 20TB. Their use may continue until the date indicated and justified by the applicant.
Since data preservation will take place on Tape Library devices, it is advisable to carefully read the description of the data sharing and preservation services (https://www.ia2.inaf.it/index.php/ia2-services/data-sharing-preservation ) offered by IA2 as well as the description of the Long-Term Preservation service (https://www.ia2.inaf.it/index.php/ia2-services/data-sharing-preservation/long-term-preservation) for the preliminary measures necessary for preparing the data for the preservation and subsequent recovery of the data.

 

Proposal submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Proposals must be submitted by completing the form available at the link: https://forms.gle/NL2rQtQ4xQVruuGYA  starting from 01/02/2026  and by 11.59pm on 28/02/2026.

In the application, the proposing research groups will be asked to specify in detail the scientific background, the technical characteristics of the code, detailing libraries, computing environment, compilers, paradigm and degree of parallelism. Furthermore, you will be asked to describe any constraints on how resources are used (for example dedicated nodes, minimum number of nodes required per run, execution time of a single run, total memory for a single job,....etc) and to indicate the period during which the calculation time will be used.

Any allocated computing time that is not used within the authorized period will expire and cannot be automatically recovered. Any requests for an extension must be submitted in accordance with the procedures set out in the call and will be subject to evaluation.

Proposers will also be asked to specify the storage space necessary for the execution of the code, within the limits specified in the relevant section of the call. This storage, not subject to backup, will be available for up to 6 months from the end of the project, and is to be understood as functional for data production (i.e. it does not correspond to preservation storage). If long-term saving of the data produced is necessary, it will be necessary to submit a further and separate request, again via the proposal submission form, for the saving space on Tape Library IA2.

Similarly to what is provided for computing resources, the application for long-term data preservation space must contain all the data necessary for the evaluation of the request: size of preservation storage space requested; type, format and size of each scientific product; description of the structure of the collection; description of the expected frequency of access as well as the data access policy; any future plans for publishing the data; all information deemed relevant for correct data preservation following the FAIR principles.

Please note that, with regard to requests for data archiving at IA2 (i.e., not only data storage, but the inclusion of the data in a proper archive), this is not covered by this call. However, it will be possible to fill in the following form, providing all the information necessary to allow the request to be approved: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Xs3Spg7MVqA2ZZZadTbiz3dfIDshJzA5XSRGvJi7rVA.

 

During the proposal evaluation phase, the Panel may request clarifications and further information from the proposers. Communication of any allocation of the requested resources will normally take place within 4-5 weeks of the closing of the call.

Additional info and Ex-post activities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project extension
A single request for an extension of a project to the subsequent call after its approval is allowed, in order to complete the unused computing time. This request does not require an additional technical/scientific description. Instead of providing scientific background, the proposer must justify the request for an extension and explain the unused resources. 
The CAT&S will evaluate the justifications and decide whether to approve the extension.
 
First come, first served resources
Starting from 01/04/2026 (the month following the closing of the call), it will also be possible to request computing resources on a “first come, first serve basis”, up to a maximum of 100,000 CORE hours (on PLEIADI System) per project, and until the resources available for this methodology, equal to 4,000,000 CORE hours, are exhausted.
 
Starting from 01/04/2026 (the month following the closing of the call), it will also be possible to request computing resources on a “first come, first served” basis for access to the PLEIADI-GPU system. Project proposals requesting up to 5,000 GPU hours each will be accepted, until the available resources for this modality, amounting to 60,000 CORE hours, are exhausted.

 
As regards Cineca and Leonardo BOOSTER, it will be possible to request hours for "tests" up to a maximum of 10,000 Standard Hours per project.
 
 
The computing resources assigned in this mode will be available for up to a maximum of 2 months from the date of first use. These proposals will also be subject to an assessment of adequacy and feasibility by USC-C and/or the management team of the aforementioned computing resources, with response times normally less than a week.
 
At the end of the project, the proponent will be asked for a short report on the results obtained and the critical issues encountered using the assigned resources. Failure to send this report precludes participation in the subsequent call.
