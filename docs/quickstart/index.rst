Quick start – First steps 
====================

Creating an account
-------------------

Connecting to the cluster
-------------------

To connect to the Pleiadi cluster frontend as a user with a certain username, execute (the dollar $ sign indicates the shell prompt):

``$ ssh <username>@pleiadi.oact.inaf.it``

For example, for the user “pippo” the login command is:

``$ ssh pippo@pleiadi.oact.inaf.it``

After executing the ``ssh`` command, the login can be completed inserting a password or without the need of inserting a password, if a public key created on your laptop is provided to the cluster.
